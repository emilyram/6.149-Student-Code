# 6.149-student-code
This is code I wrote as a student in this class.
We were provided skeletons for the assignments (example: Your code must do x or y) and some reference code to call graphics or things like pygame or matplotlib.

This shows how I think as a programmer above all else.
My code files are:
Hangman.py
Battleship.py
grade.py (a litle grade calculator I made)

The rest are reference files not created by me.
